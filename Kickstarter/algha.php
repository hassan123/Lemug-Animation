                        <p>Ah yeah, Alaga! (I do not intend to offend anyone with the use of the word Alaga; this is intended to be a very celebratory phrase! I love all people.)
Each set contains a custom Alaga die, 14 other assorted dice. D6 (11), and D8, D10, and D12 (1 each) as well complete directions how to play. </p>
<p>My friends and I have been playing Alaga for over two years. The fan base is growing every time we play with someone new. People love the game and want a set of their own. </p>
<p>I always have people asking me if I can make a set of Alaga for them. So far Alaga has traveled from Colorado to Southern California, Minneapolis, and Chicago, New York and recently to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. I actually just sent my last copy with a friend teaching abroad in Ethiopia. Everywhere we play it, the game is a hit. </p>
<p>It has become popular enough I could start making it in a larger scale. I've already contacted the manufacturers and suppliers who have everything I need to produce the game. Artwork is prepared and finalized. I am ready to submit my large orders as soon as my project is funded. </p>

<p>So I began the Kickstarter campaign so I could produce the game at a more reasonable cost. If I can order larger quantities of bags and dice at one time the unit cost can come down significantly. I look forward to sharing Alaga with the masses. I hope you want to try Alaga. You will love playing this game.
Every pledge level except Air High Five! Receives at least one set of Alaga. Each set contains a custom Alaga die, 14 other assorted dice and complete directions how to play. The whole game (dice and directions) will be in a custom Alaga bag. </p>

                       <div class="cb-brief-text">
<p>The risks and challenges that we may face are: 
- possible delays in production, with early editions there was a month or so delay in receiving some dice from the supplier. </p>
<p>- getting all sets shipped in a timely manner, as this is our first Kickstarter campaign and we are not sure about the possible popularity.</p>
<p>Regardless, we will keep all of our backers updated along the way...and everyone WILL get their Alaga. </p>
