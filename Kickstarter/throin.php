                        <p>Throin is a group based role-playing dungeon crawler that pays homage the classics while adding its own style with fresh mechanics. Lead a band of three heroes through a broken land, ripped apart by unknown forces. </p>
<p>Throin is a modern take on a classic RPG formula. You're put in control of three heroes trying to survive a world devastated by war. Adventuring in Throin will take you across open land, into deep dungeons and even put you in control of rebuilding a desolated town.</p>
<p>A great evil, nearly destroying Throin in ages past, has returned. It is up to you to create a band of heroes to fight this darkness. The game takes place on two continents floating in the sky, as well as hundreds of minor islands. Throin has been marred by war and strife for thousands of years and the landscape is a reflection of that. </p>
<p>• Character Customization! Character customization in Throin is a refreshing take on the RPG Level-Up formula. Instead of skills and stats after X experience, your choices throughout the game affect your heroes. From the weapons you choose to forge, to the add-ons you choose for their housing, every decision has an impact on your heroes.</p>
<p>• You did what with my weapon?! Each character only starts with one weapon, one set of armor and four skills. You'll use the materials you find in the world to shape and morph your characters in to the heroes they'll become. Every decision you make has a permanent and lasting impact on your hero who resonates in the manner they play and interact with the world. </p>
<p>• Town Building! Using building blueprints you find, the people you rescue, along with the help of a mysterious stranger, you'll use ancient devices to rebuild a lost town. You'll have to choose wisely however, as some building decisions permanently prevent other choices. </p>
<p>• Combat!  Combat in Throin allows you to choose real-time, turn-based or a unique blend of both. The core system of Throin takes two old school styles of gameplay and merging them into one seamless combat experience.

<p>•  Adventure! You'll adventure through dozens of dungeons, castles and open world areas while finding hidden passageways, collecting materials and crushing your foes. </p>
<p>• Story! The game features a deep and engaging story-line that spans generations. As you play through the game you'll learn about the history of Throin and your heroes, as well as taking a part in shaping your heroes past with the unique trait system. </p>
<p>I've been working on Throin every spare moment for some time now. Until a couple of weeks ago, I was mainly focused on getting the ideas down and making sure I could achieve the look, feel and gameplay that I wanted. 
Now that the prototype is finished Throin is ready for the next phase of development. While all the basics are done, coded and ready, and the art-style has been defined and refined, I would like to be able to put in the additional hours and potentially hire some extra hands to move it out of the prototype stage and into a full game. </p>
<p>I'll be using Kickstarter to move Throin into this next stage of development; building upon the foundation to bring you a great game. The funding will be used for: </p>
<p>• Hiring: A game is not easy to make, so I'll be using Kickstarter funds to hire on the extra hands I need to make Throin a reality. </p>
<p>• Surviving: Paying the bills - you know how it goes. </p>
<p>• Expanding: Take a look at the stretch chart. I've spent a lot of time crunching the numbers so you know exactly what you're getting for your buck.</p>
<p>• Software...ing : The license to use software can be extremely expensive, and while I own most of the software needed to make the game, buying the additional pieces that put that extra layer of polish on it can be very pricey
