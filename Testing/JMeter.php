        <h2>JMeter testing</h2>
        <p class="info">Wantro is 100% compatible with Apache JMeter. You can upload any JMeter test, including tests that use plugins and advanced features, and it will work on Wantro. We can scale it for you automatically, or you can choose your preferred options. You can even choose specific versions of JMeter for replay.
 JMeter is a load testing and performance measuring tool from the Apache project. It has Selenium capabilities, so can be used to do functional testing of your sites, which is where Sauce Labs shines. We don't really recommend building a load test suite using Sauce Labs as your primary source of load.
