               Business development often helps with business start-ups. They might assist in items such as start-up budgets, business plans, and any other items that might be necessary to get a fledgling business off the ground. Their relationship to the new business might end there after having just covered the basics or it might continue on to other activities. Development of a marketing strategy is another area covered by a business developer. Many businesses struggle with devising ways to effectively market their business to prospective clients. A business developer can use his or her knowledge and expertise to guide the business owner in creating a marketing plan that will generate a great deal of new business.
